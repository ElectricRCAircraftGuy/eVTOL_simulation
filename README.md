# TODO:

1. [x] break apart into multiple modules, each with a header and source file.
1. [nah] add setters and getters, perhaps; nah.
1. (optional) add namespaces to modules

Next:
1. [ ] add clang-format
1. [x] add gtest and a few basic unit tests
    1. [x] add a test fixture as a `FRIEND_TEST` in order to test private class functions. See example gtest code here!: https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/advanced.md#testing-private-code
1. [x] finish/fix all build instructions below

# Assumptions

1. Provided Assumptions
    - Each vehicle starts the simulation with a fully-charged battery
    - Each vehicle instantaneously reaches Cruise Speed
    - Each vehicle is airborne for the full use of the battery, and is immediately in line for the
      charger after running out of battery power.

1. Additional Assumptions:
    - faults can only occur during **flying**, NOT during waiting for a charger, or charging.
    - faults don't make the vehicle stop flying; it keeps flying; you just count the faults
    - when the plane runs out of fuel it is instantly at the charger without adding distance
    - only charge when the battery is empty (at 0% State of Charge (SoC))
    - "the probability of fault per hour" statistic should be evenly spread across the time steps, to
      provide a more-realistic "real-life" simulation, providing for the ability to run this simulation
      "real time" if you wanted to train ground support personal to actually respond to the emergencies
      and operations at the predicted real-time cadence.
    - once a vehicle gets on the charger, it will stay there until full
    - each vehicle is fully loaded with passengers every flight

# Build

Install dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install ccache
# git lfs; see: https://packagecloud.io/github/git-lfs/install
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash

# install gtest
# From my full instructions here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/75718815/4561887

sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake

# You can find some of these instructions, here: 
# https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/googletest
time git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
cd googletest        # "Main directory of the cloned repository."
mkdir build          # "Create a directory to hold the build output."
cd build
time cmake ..        # "Generate native make build scripts for GoogleTest."
                        # Takes ~2 seconds.
time make            # Run those makefiles just autogenerated by cmake above.
                        # Takes ~10 seconds.
sudo make install    # Install the .a library files, and headers, into 
                        # /user/local/.
```

Get this repo:
```bash
# get this repo
git clone https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eVTOL_simulation.git
cd eVTOL_simulation
git lfs pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Update this repo whenever you need to pull my latest changes:
```bash
git pull  
git lfs pull  
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build and run the program
```bash
# build and run both the unit tests and main program
./build.sh 

# build and run ONLY the unit tests
./build.sh tests 

# build and run ONLY the main program
./build.sh main 


# Just run the already-built unit tests, without rebuilding
time bin/evtol_simulation_unittest

# Just run the already-built simulation, without rebuilding
