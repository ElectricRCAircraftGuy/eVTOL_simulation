# eVTOL_simulation

C++ skills demonstration: a simulator to simulate some eVTOL aircraft flying around to see how they perform carrying passengers when limited chargers are available and they all have different specs, such as range, recharge time, and number of passengers they can carry. 

Since each simulation run injects randomness using [C++'s robust pseudo-random number generators](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random), the results of repeated runs of the simulation comprise a [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) simulation.

# TODO:

1. [x] break apart into multiple modules, each with a header and source file.
1. [nah] add setters and getters, perhaps; nah.
1. (optional) add namespaces to modules

Next:
1. [x] add clang-format
1. [x] add gtest and a few basic unit tests
    1. [x] add a test fixture as a `FRIEND_TEST` in order to test private class functions. See example gtest code here!: https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/advanced.md#testing-private-code
1. [x] finish/fix all build instructions below

# Assumptions

1. Provided Assumptions
    - Each vehicle starts the simulation with a fully-charged battery
    - Each vehicle instantaneously reaches Cruise Speed
    - Each vehicle is airborne for the full use of the battery, and is immediately in line for the
      charger after running out of battery power.
    - Chargers are a scarce resoure, as there are only 3 of them, so vehicles must wait in line if they are all taken. 
    - The simulation will cover 20 vehicles randomly selected from 5 different companies, flying and charging continuously, as needed, for 3 hours.

1. Additional Assumptions:
    - faults can only occur during **flying**, NOT during waiting for a charger, or charging.
    - faults don't make the vehicle stop flying; it keeps flying; you just count the faults
    - when the plane runs out of fuel it is instantly at the charger without adding distance
    - only charge when the battery is empty (at 0% State of Charge (SoC))
    - "the probability of fault per hour" statistic should be evenly spread across the time steps, to
      provide a more-realistic "real-life" simulation, providing for the ability to run this simulation
      "real time" if you wanted to train ground support personal to actually respond to the emergencies
      and operations at the predicted real-time cadence.
    - once a vehicle gets on the charger, it will stay there until full
    - each vehicle is fully loaded with passengers every flight

# Notes to self

1. To see the full effect of what `clang-format` did, as I tweak the `.clang-format` config file and all, run this:
    ```bash
    git difftool 1f8e7ec86e29eb630924459fbbccb8ed77d9070d..e1c49be9e7037c86596341e43decaacc7c6863e8

Run clang-format to auto-format the C++ code:
```bash
# from the root of the repo
./run_clang-format.sh
```

Build and run the program
```bash
# build and run both the unit tests and main program
./build.sh 

# build and run ONLY the unit tests
./build.sh tests 

# build and run ONLY the main program
./build.sh main 


# Just run the already-built unit tests, without rebuilding
